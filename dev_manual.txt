to start express server, do this in terminal: 
npm init -y
npm i express
npm i --save-dev nodemon
then in the json file, put "devStart" inside of scripts and after the colon put 
"nodemon [servername].js" 
then, the server can be continuosly ran with "npm run devStart"
By doing it like this, you wont have to continuosly re start the server manually through the terminal.
An example of this is in the file package.json
----------------------------
Helpful git hub stuff to remember. These are REMINDERS, not a full tutorial:
to add:
git add .
git commit -m "message describing to commit"
git push -u origin main
this pushes to main branch in the github, so now your code is saved in github.
to push to a branch instead, first make a branch with:
git checkout -b [branch-name]
then, add to the branch:
git add .
Now, we can push that branch to github:
git push origin [branch-name]
then, through github, do a pull request to merge the branch. New changes should be done in a branch,
and later merged so that we don't accidentally overwrite progress.
If you need to update your code to match what is in github, we must pull them. do:
git pull origin master
Make sure you commit your changes and push them to github, and try to keep up to date with what is on github.
If you pull without saving your own progress, your progress may be overwritten.
